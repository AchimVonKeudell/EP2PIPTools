CROSS SECTION DATA FORMAT
In downloaded files, each collision process is defined by a block consisting of
1st line
Keyword in capitals indicating the type of the collision. Possible collision types are elastic, effective, excitation,
ionization, or attachment (capital letters required, key words are case sensitive), where "elastic" is used to denote
the elastic momentum transfer cross section and where "effective" denotes the total momentum transfer cross section (sum
of elastic momentum transfer and total inelastic cross sections).  The latter is useful for solving the Boltzmann
equation in the 2-term approximation.
2nd line
Name of the target particle species. This name is a character string, freely chosen by the user, e.g. "Ar". Optionally
for excitation processes, the name of the corresponding excited state can be specified on the same line, separated from
the first name either by arrow "->" (dash + greater than) or by double-head arrow "<->" (less than + dash +
greater than), e.g. "Ar -> Ar*" and "Ar <-> Ar*", respectively. In the later case BOLSIG+ will automatically
define the inverse superelastic process, constructing the superelastic cross-section by detailed balancing, and
considering the indicated excited state as the target. In this case, the ratio of statistical weights must be input in
the 3rd line (see below).
3rd line
For elastic and effective collisions, the ratio of the electron mass to the target particle mass. For excitation or
ionization collisions, the electron energy loss (nominally the threshold energy) in eV. For attachment, the 3rd line is
missing. In case of an excitation process where an excited state has been indicated on the 2nd line using double-head
arrow "<->", the 3rd line must specify also ratio of the statistical weights of the final state to the initial state
as the second parameter in 3rd line this is needed by BOLSIG+ to calculate the de-excitation cross-section. The
statistical weight ratio, if given, will also be used by the automatic superelastics option in BOLSIG+. If this ratio is
not provided then BOLSIG+ will assume it unity.
from 4th line (optionally)
User comments and reference information, maximum 100 lines. The only constraint on format is that these comment lines
must not start with a number.
Finally
Table of the cross section as a function of energy. The table starts and ends by a line of dashes "------" (at least 5),
and has otherwise two numbers per line: the energy in eV and the cross section in m2.

DATABASE:         IST-Lisbon database
PERMLINK:         www.lxcat.net/IST-Lisbon
DESCRIPTION:      IST-Lisbon database contains up-to-date electron-neutral scattering cross sections (together with the
                  measured swarm parameters used to validate these data), resulting from the research effort of the
                  Group N-Plasmas Reactive: Modelling and Engineering (N-PRiME) with IPFN/IST (Instituto de Plasmas e
                  Fusao Nuclear / Instituto Superior Tecnico), Lisbon, Portugal.  The data, compiled from the
                  literature, correspond to contributions from different authors (see detailed references in the
                  database). For each gas the database presents a COMPLETE SET of cross sections, validated against
                  measured swarm parameters by solving the two-term homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation. In most
                  cases, predictions are in agreement with measurements within 1-20%, for reduced electric fields E/N ~
                  1e-4 - 500 Td. To improve predictions at low E/N, some sets need to be completed with rotational cross
                  sections, also available in the database.

COMMENT: M. Santos, C. Noel, T. Belmonte and L.L. Alves ''Microwave capillary plasmas in helium at atmospheric pressure'' 2014 J.
         Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 47 265201 1-18. Cross sections were defined for energies up to 1 keV and were adjusted as to yield
         good agreement between calculated and measured swarm parameters. The calculations use a two-term Boltzmann solver with
         the SST growth model. The cross sections are handled choosing a linear interpolation scheme with no extrapolation after
         the last energy point, within energy-grids with 1000 points and constant step-sizes comprised between 0.01 and 1 eV,
         according to the (low/high) reduced-field values considered.
         The present cross section set updates its previous version, published in L.L. Alves et al ''Comparisons of sets of
         electronâ€“neutral scattering cross sections and swarm parameters in noble gases: II. Helium and neon'' 2013 J. Phys. D:
         Appl. Phys. 46 334002 1-22.
         The elastic momentum-transfer cross section corresponds to the one proposed by Crompton et al at low energies, Milloy
         and Crompton at intermediate energies, and Belmonte et al at high energies. The inelastic electron cross sections for
         transitions n(2s+1)S -> nâ€™(2sâ€™+1)lâ€™ with n < 3, 1 < nâ€™ < 5, lâ€™ = S,P,D,F are obtained from
         Belmonte et al, by multiplying the excitation cross sections for the metastables and the n3P states by factors of 0.31
         and 0.60, respectively, and by multiplying the excitation cross sections for the n1P states by a factor of 1.66.
         For the rest of transitions, the cross sections are obtained from the analytical expressions proposed by Ralchenko et
         al.
         The ionization cross section is taken from the measurements of Rapp and Englander-Golden, for electron energies below
         100 eV, and from Belmonte et al, between 100â€“1000 eV.
