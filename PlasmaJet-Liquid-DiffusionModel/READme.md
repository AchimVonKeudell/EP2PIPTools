# Diffusion model Plasma Liquid Interactions

Model of the convection-diffusion equation of H2O2 transport in a liquid treated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet.

Input of the model is the flux of H2O2 provided by the plasma jet and the mean velocity in the liquid determined by PIV measurements. In the case of only diffusion, the velocity was set to 0 m/s.

The concentration of H2O2 is plotted either at different depths over time or as the mean concentration in the liquid evolving. Heatmaps of the H2O2 concentration are created for the only diffusion case and the convection plus diffusion case.

GIFs of the two cases are also created.
